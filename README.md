# Interactive Pendulum Fractal

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License%20-%20MIT%20-%20green?style=flat-square)

This repository is my fourth repo on double pendulums, in the [last one](https://github.com/Mattia04/ALotOfPendulums2) i created some high resolution images of the double pendulum fractal, if you are interested in how this fractal works see [this article](https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~vmarconi/fiscomp/Double.pdf).

This time my aim is to create an interactive app where you can wonder around the beautiful structure of this fractal.

## Run the program 

From the `InteractivePendulumFractal` directory:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..

wait for building then:

    make
    python ../app.py
